#   An ISSN takes the following form:
#     - the acronym ISSN is shown in capitals,
#     - followed by a space,
#     - followed by two groups of four digits, separated by a hyphen.
#
#   The number must always be preceded by the ISSN acronym.
#
# From Wikipedia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Serial_Number on 1/31/2014
#   The format of the ISSN is an eight digit number, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers.
#   The last digit, which may be 0â€“9 or an X, is a check digit.
#
# validates :identifier, :format => {:with => /\A\d\d\d\d-\d\d\d[\dxX]\z/, :message => 'Invalid ISSN.'}

class Identifier::Global::Issn < Identifier::Global
  validate :using_issn_class

  # Examples from issn.org: ISSN 0317-8471, ISSN 1050-124X
  # @todo the validator for this identifier has been perverted so as to *NOT* require the preamble 'ISSN ', even though the ISSN spec is quite specific about its being there, because the Bibtex gem does not return it with the ISSN vslue as it should.
