# A SequenceRelationship relates to strings of DNA/RNA/AA to one other in the form:
#  #subject is_a #type of #object 
#  subject ForwardPrimer of object
#
# In this case the subject is the primer, then object is the sequence using that primer.  
# Also use for deriving sequences from queries, etc.
#
# @!attribute subject_sequence_id 
#   @return [Integer]
#     the subject sequence 
#
# @!attribute object_sequence_id 
#   @return [Integer]
#     the subject sequence
